Overview

IRC-AK-MSN is a project aimed at creating a custom Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server. The project enables individuals to gain insights into the functioning of IRC networks, learn about network protocols, and experience firsthand the process of setting up and managing an IRC server.
Objectives

The primary objectives of the IRC-AK-MSN project are:

    Education: To provide individuals with a practical learning experience in networking protocols and server administration.

    Hands-on Experience: To allow individuals to set up and configure their own IRC server environment and connect to it using an IRC client.

    Understanding Standards: To foster an understanding of standard protocols and their role in facilitating communication between networked computers.

Getting Started

To get started with IRC-AK-MSN, follow these steps:

    Setup Environment: Install the necessary software and dependencies to run an IRC server on your local machine or a server.

    Configuration: Configure the IRC server software according to your preferences and requirements. This may include setting up channels, defining user permissions, and configuring network settings.

    Testing: Use an IRC client to connect to your server and test its functionality. Ensure that users can join channels, send messages, and perform other typical IRC actions.

    Documentation: Document your server setup and configuration for future reference and troubleshooting.

Resources
